# Contributing

Thanks for checking out the project! This started as my internship assignment, but I'm happy to accept improvements and suggestions.

## How to contribute

**Found a bug?**
- Open an issue describing what happened
- Include your operating system and Java version
- Steps to reproduce the problem would be helpful

**Have an idea for a feature?**
- Check if someone already suggested it in the issues
- Open a new issue explaining what you'd like to see
- I'm especially interested in usability improvements

**Want to contribute code?**
- Fork the repository
- Make your changes
- Test them thoroughly (especially the conversion math!)
- Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Code style

Nothing too strict, but try to:
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep methods reasonably short
- Follow the existing formatting style

## Testing

Since this is a GUI app, most testing is manual. If you make changes:
- Test all the temperature conversions
- Try edge cases (negative temperatures, very large numbers)
- Make sure the real-time updates still work smoothly
- Check that keyboard shortcuts still work

## Ideas for contributions

Some things that would be cool to add:
- Better error messages
- More keyboard shortcuts
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional temperature scales
- Export functionality for history
- Better visual design

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue if you have questions about the code or want to discuss potential changes.

Thanks for your interest in making this better!
